/*
Operator Precedence

This is the general order of solving an expression. (start from bracket() to +,-)
   
    ()

    **            // if there multiple power operator then we will solve form (RIGHT to LEFT).

    *,/,%

    +,-


    REMEMBER: for (*,/,% ....+,-) this this we move LEFT to RIGHT.....during solving

Operator Precedence (Example):

(2+1)*3 = 9

3/1+2**2 = 7

4+1*6/2 = 7
